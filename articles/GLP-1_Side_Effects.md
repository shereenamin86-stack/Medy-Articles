  <h1> GLP-1 Weight Loss Treatments: Common Side Effects and How to Manage Them</h1>

  <p>
    GLP-1 medicines, such as <strong>Wegovy</strong> and <strong>Mounjaro</strong>, are widely prescribed for 
    <strong>weight loss</strong> and <strong>Type 2 diabetes management</strong>. 
    These treatments slow digestion, reduce appetite, and help regulate blood sugar. 
    While highly effective, many people experience side effects during the first few weeks or when their dose increases. 
    The good news is that most <strong>GLP-1 side effects</strong> are predictable, usually temporary, and very manageable with the right strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide explains the most common <strong>side effects of GLP-1 medications</strong>, why they happen, 
    and practical steps to minimise discomfort. Whether you are just starting out on treatment, or increasing your dose, 
    understanding side effects helps you to stay on track and achieve the best results.

  <h2 id="why-glp1-side-effects">Why GLP-1 medicines cause side effects</h2>

  <p>
    GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic a natural hormone that slows stomach emptying. 
    This is one of the main ways these medicines reduce appetite and support weight loss. 
    However, because food stays in the stomach for longer, symptoms such as nausea, bloating, and fullness can occur, 
    especially early in treatment or after dose increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    GLP-1 medications can also affect gut motility, hydration, and appetite cues. 
    As your body adjusts, these symptoms typically settle within a few days or weeks. 
    Knowing why side effects develop makes them easier to manage.
  </p>

  <h2 id="common-glp1-side-effects">Common GLP-1 side effects</h2>

  <h3 id="nausea">1. Nausea</h3>

  <p>
    Nausea is the most common <strong>GLP-1 side effect</strong>, particularly during the first two to four weeks of treatment, or after increasing the dose. 
    It occurs because digestion slows, leaving food in the stomach for longer.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage nausea</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eat <strong>small, frequent meals</strong> rather than large portions.</li>
    <li>Avoid high fat, greasy, spicy or strong-smelling foods.</li>
    <li>Try ginger, peppermint or fennel tea, or sugar free mints.</li>
    <li>Sip fluids <strong>between meals</strong> instead of with them.</li>
    <li>Avoid lying down immediately after eating.</li>
    <li>Get fresh air: taking a short walk can help to relieve symptoms.</li>
    <li>Speak to your healthcare provider if nausea is severe or persistent, as your dose may need adjusting and/or you may benefit from a trial of anti-sickness medication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="vomiting">2. Vomiting</h3>

  <p>
    Vomiting may occur alongside nausea, especially with heavy meals or rapid dose escalation. 
    It is generally temporary but should be closely monitored.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage vomiting</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow the same strategies used for nausea.</li>
    <li>Take small sips of water, electrolytes or oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration.</li>
    <li>When ready to eat, choose bland foods such as toast, crackers, or plain rice. Eat little and often.</li>
    <li>Avoid alcohol until symptoms have completely settled.</li>
    <li>Seek medical advice if vomiting lasts more than 24 hours or worsens, if it is accompanied by abdominal pain or if you notice signs of dehydration, such as less frequent passing of urine or a feeling of light-headedness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="diarrhoea">3. Diarrhoea</h3>

  <p>
    Diarrhoea can result from changes in gut movement caused by GLP-1 medicines. 
    It usually appears early in treatment and often resolves as your body adapts.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage diarrhoea</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.</li>
    <li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and high fat foods.</li>
    <li>Eat simple foods such as rice, bananas, and yoghurt.</li>
    <li>Consider safe over-the-counter remedies, such as loperamide and oral rehydration sachets.</li>
    <li>Contact a healthcare professional if diarrhoea is severe or continues for more than a few days, or if you note signs of dehydration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="constipation">4. Constipation</h3>

  <p>
    Constipation can happen due to slower digestion and reduced overall food intake. 
    For some people, it is one of the more persistent GLP-1 side effects.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage constipation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase fibre gradually with wholegrains, fruit (prunes and figs are a great choice), and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Stay well hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li>Include light exercise, such as walking, to support digestion.</li>
    <li>Use fibre supplements or mild laxatives if needed - your local community pharmacist can advise you on the most suitable option.</li>
    <li>Seek help if constipation is painful or continues for more than a week, if you are straining when passing a bowel motion or if you notice any blood in your stools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="bloating">5. Bloating and indigestion</h3>

  <p>
    Slower stomach emptying can cause bloating, early fullness, and indigestion. 
    These symptoms usually improve as your body adjusts to the GLP-1 treatment.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage bloating</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Avoid carbonated drinks, chewing gum, and drinking through a straw.</li>
    <li>Choose smaller portions at mealtimes.</li>
    <li>Try peppermint tea or capsules to relieve bloating.</li>
    <li>Limit high fat foods, which can take longer to digest.</li>
    <li>Speak to your local pharmacist about a trial of anti-gas medication, such as simethicone-based preparations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="injection-site-reactions">6. Injection site reactions</h3>

  <p>
    Redness, itching, or small lumps can occur where you inject GLP-1 medicines such as Wegovy or Mounjaro.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage injection site reactions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rotate your injection sites between the abdomen, thigh, and upper arm.</li>
    <li>Allow the pen to reach room temperature before injecting.</li>
    <li>Follow proper injection technique as advised by your healthcare team.</li>
    <li>Try taking a non-drowsy antihistamine, or applying antihistamine cream to the area to reduce itching.</li>
    <li>Contact a healthcare professional if reactions are painful, spreading, or worsening.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="headache">7. Headache</h3>

  <p>
    Headaches may be linked to dehydration, reduced calorie intake, or changes in blood sugar while using GLP-1 medications.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage headaches</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drink water regularly throughout the day.</li>
    <li>Eat balanced meals, even if your appetite is lower.</li>
    <li>Avoid skipping meals.</li>
    <li>Use simple pain relief, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, if suitable for you.</li>
  <li>Ensure you are getting adequate sleep.</li>  
    <li>Seek advice if headaches become severe or persistent, or if you notice any vision changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fatigue">8. Fatigue and low energy</h3>

  <p>
    Feeling tired or low in energy is common during the first weeks of GLP-1 treatment. 
    This may be due to eating less, dehydration, or metabolic changes.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage fatigue</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure you are eating enough at each meal.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated and pace your day if needed.</li>
    <li>Prioritise good quality sleep.</li>
    <li>Consider gentle exercise, such as walking, to support energy levels.</li>
    <li>Speak to a healthcare professional if fatigue is severe or does not improve.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3 id="indigestion-heartburn">9. Indigestion and heartburn</h3>

<p>
  Some people taking GLP-1 medicines experience <strong>indigestion, acid reflux, or heartburn</strong>, particularly in the early stages of treatment or when stepping up to a higher dose. Because GLP-1 medications slow stomach emptying, food can remain in the stomach for longer, increasing pressure and acidity. This may lead to discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen.
</p>

<p><strong>How to manage indigestion and heartburn</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eat <strong>smaller meals</strong> and avoid lying down for at least two hours after eating.</li>
  <li>Reduce trigger foods such as tomatoes, citrus, chocolate, coffee, spicy meals, and high fat dishes.</li>
  <li>Avoid eating late at night.</li>
  <li>Consider over-the-counter antacids or alginate-based products if they are suitable for you.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated and avoid carbonated drinks.</li>
  <li>If symptoms persist, worsen, or interfere with sleep, speak to a healthcare professional to review your treatment.</li>
</ul>

  <h3 id="serious-side-effects">10. Less common but important side effects</h3>

  <p>
    Although rare, some GLP-1 side effects need urgent attention.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> – severe abdominal pain that may spread to the back, nausea, and vomiting. Seek urgent medical care.</li>
    <li><strong>Gallbladder issues</strong> – abdominal pain, fever, or yellowing of the skin or eyes.</li>
    <li><strong>Allergic reactions</strong> – swelling of the face or throat, breathing difficulties, or a widespread rash. Call emergency services immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These events are uncommon, but knowing the warning signs is essential for safe treatment.
  </p>

  <h2 id="patient-reported-side-effects">Patient reported side effects</h2>

  <p>
    Some patients report additional symptoms with GLP-1 therapy that are less well-studied but still important to recognise and discuss.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sulphur-burps">Sulphur burps</h3>

  <p>
    A number of people describe unusual or sulphur-smelling burps after starting a GLP-1 medicine. 
    This may be related to changes in digestion and gut bacteria as the stomach empties more slowly.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage sulphur burps</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid very high protein meals that may increase sulphur production.</li>
    <li>Eat smaller, more frequent meals.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated and consider probiotics if recommended by your clinician.</li>
    <li>Minimise alcohol and carbonated drink consumption.</li>
    <li>Seek medical advice if symptoms are severe, persistent, or associated with significant abdominal pain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="alopecia">Alopecia (hair thinning or loss)</h3>

  <p>
    Some patients notice hair thinning or increased shedding while on GLP-1 treatment. 
    This can be associated with rapid weight loss, nutritional changes, or general stress on the body.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage alopecia</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a balanced diet with adequate protein, iron, and key vitamins.</li>
    <li>Avoid harsh hair treatments, tight hairstyles, and excessive heat styling.</li>
    <li>Monitor changes and discuss them with a healthcare professional if hair loss is significant or distressing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="irregular-menstrual-bleeding">Irregular menstrual bleeding</h3>

  <p>
    Some women experience spotting or irregular menstrual cycles while using GLP-1 medicines. 
    These changes may relate to weight loss, altered hormone balance, or metabolic shifts.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How to manage irregular menstrual bleeding</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track your menstrual cycles and note any changes in timing or flow.</li>
    <li>Maintain good nutrition and hydration, especially during dose changes.</li>
    <li>Speak with your healthcare provider if bleeding is heavy, prolonged, or accompanied by pain or other symptoms.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These patient reported side effects are generally less common, but raising them with the Medy Clinical Team helps ensure your treatment remains safe and tailored to you.
  </p>

  <h2 id="reduce-side-effects">How to reduce GLP-1 side effects before they start</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Follow a gradual <strong>dose escalation</strong> plan as advised by Medy Clinical Team.</li>
    <li>Eat mindfully and avoid large, heavy meals. Do not undereat.</li>
    <li>Stay well hydrated every day.</li>
