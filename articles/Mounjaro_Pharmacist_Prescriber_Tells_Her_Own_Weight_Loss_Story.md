<h1>Patient Story: A Pharmacist Prescriber’s Own Journey With Mounjaro</h1>

<p>After more than a year of supporting patients through their GLP-1 weight loss journeys, one of our UK-registered Pharmacist Prescribers reached an important realisation. She had watched these treatments transform people’s confidence, health and quality of life. Eventually she recognised that it was time to focus on her own wellbeing and take the same step she had guided so many others through.</p>

<p>She had lived with a BMI above 30 and understood her increased health risks, particularly as someone with mixed British and Arab heritage. Despite her clinical background, she was facing real day-to-day limitations. Persistent low back pain affected her mobility and, most emotionally, she had stopped riding her horse. With the weight she had gained, she felt it was no longer in the best interest of her horse’s welfare to ride. She describes this as a defining moment, saying: <em>“Realising that my weight could impact my horse’s welfare was the moment everything changed for me. I knew I could not ignore it any longer.”</em></p>

<p>Before discovering Mounjaro, she had tried many recognised weight loss approaches, including Slimming World, very low calorie diets (VLCDs) of around 800 calories per day and several meal replacement programmes. While some methods worked for short periods, none provided the long-term sustainability she needed.</p>

<p>During the COVID period, she found motivation again and successfully lost 25 kilograms through a keto lifestyle, maintaining her results for almost three years. However, an all-inclusive holiday followed by significant life stresses caused the weight to return more quickly than expected. She reflects on this time saying: <em>“I had worked so hard to lose the weight and keep it off. Watching it come back during a stressful period was incredibly discouraging.”</em></p>

<h2>Starting Mounjaro: Immediate and Noticeable Effects</h2>

<p>In May, she began her Mounjaro journey, choosing the same treatment she had prescribed to hundreds of her own patients. From the first dose, she noticed a clear physiological shift. She experienced mild nausea on the injection day but also a powerful reduction in appetite and a complete switch off of food noise that lasted until the next injection was due. She recalls: <em>“The silence in my mind around food was unbelievable. It was the first time in years that I felt genuinely in control.”</em></p>

<p>When stepping up to the 5 milligram dose, the journey became more challenging. She experienced more intense nausea, complete appetite suppression, fatigue and sulphur burps. These symptoms were uncomfortable at first but gradually eased as her body adapted. She chose not to increase the dose further as progress was steady and she felt stable.</p>

<p>She also noticed some hair shedding but recognised this from her previous keto experience and attributed it to rapid weight loss rather than the medication.</p>

<h2>A Life Reclaimed: 23 Kilograms Down and a Return to Normal BMI</h2>

<p>Today, she is 23 kilograms lighter and firmly back within the normal BMI range. With around 6 to 8 kilograms left to reach her personal goal, she already feels like herself again. Her low back pain has eased significantly and, most importantly, she is riding her horse again. She shares: <em>“Getting back in the saddle was emotional. I finally felt confident that I was strong enough and that I was doing right by my horse.”</em></p>

<h2>A Clinician’s Perspective: Why Proper Support Matters</h2>

<p>Experiencing both sides of the journey has strengthened her belief that GLP-1 treatments work best when patients receive proper, personalised support. Many online providers rely on quick, asynchronous consultations that offer minimal follow-up, limited guidance and no real relationship with the prescriber. A more supportive and human approach leads to better outcomes and greater confidence.</p>

<p>Video consultations, ongoing check-ins and clear advice on side effects, dosing and building long-term healthy habits can make a meaningful difference. This is exactly what <strong>Medy</strong> offers. Patients receive tailored guidance, compassionate support and market-leading value. Medy combines clinical expertise with genuine care, helping people achieve results and maintain them sustainably.</p>
