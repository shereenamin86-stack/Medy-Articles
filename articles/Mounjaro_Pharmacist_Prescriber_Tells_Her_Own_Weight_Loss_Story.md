<h1>Patient Story: A Pharmacist Prescriber’s Own Journey With Mounjaro</h1>

<p>After more than a year of supporting patients through their GLP-1 weight loss journeys, a UK-registered Pharmacist Prescriber reached an important realisation. They had watched these treatments transform people’s confidence, health and quality of life. Eventually they recognised that it was time to focus on their own wellbeing and take the same step they had guided so many others through.</p>

<p>They had lived with a BMI above 30 and understood their increased health risks, particularly as someone with mixed British and Arab heritage. Despite their clinical background, they were facing real day-to-day limitations. Persistent low back pain affected mobility and, most emotionally, they had stopped riding their horse. With the weight they had gained, they felt it was no longer in the best interest of their horse’s welfare to ride. They describe this moment as a turning point, saying: <em>“Realising that my weight could impact my horse’s welfare was the moment everything changed for me. I knew I could not ignore it any longer.”</em></p>

<p>Before discovering Mounjaro, they had tried many recognised weight loss approaches, including Slimming World, very low calorie diets (VLCDs) of around 800 calories per day and several meal replacement programmes. While some methods worked for short periods, none provided the long-term sustainability they needed.</p>

<p>During the COVID period, they found motivation again and successfully lost 25 kilograms through a keto lifestyle, maintaining their results for almost three years. However, an all-inclusive holiday followed by significant life stresses caused the weight to return more quickly than expected. They reflect on this period saying: <em>“I had worked so hard to lose the weight and keep it off. Watching it come back during a stressful period was incredibly discouraging.”</em></p>

<h2>Starting Mounjaro: Immediate and Noticeable Effects</h2>

<p>In May, they began their Mounjaro journey, choosing the same treatment they had prescribed to hundreds of their own patients. From the first dose, they noticed a clear physiological shift. They experienced mild nausea on the injection day but also a powerful reduction in appetite and a complete switch off of food noise that lasted until the next injection was due. They recall: <em>“The silence in my mind around food was unbelievable. It was the first time in years that I felt genuinely in control.”</em></p>

<p>When stepping up to the 5 milligram dose, the journey became more challenging. They experienced more intense nausea, complete appetite suppression, fatigue and sulphur burps. These symptoms were uncomfortable at first but gradually eased as the body adapted. They chose not to increase the dose further as progress was steady and they felt stable.</p>

<p>They also experienced some hair shedding but recognised this from their previous keto experience and attributed it to rapid weight loss rather than the medication.</p>

<h2>A Life Reclaimed: 23 Kilograms Down and a Return to Normal BMI</h2>

<p>Today, they are 23 kilograms lighter and firmly back within the normal BMI range. With around 6 to 8 kilograms left to reach their personal goal, they already feel like themselves again. Their low back pain has eased significantly and, most importantly, they are riding their horse again. They share: <em>“Getting back in the saddle was emotional. I finally felt confident that I was strong enough and that I was doing right by my horse.”</em></p>

<h2>A Clinician’s Perspective: Why Proper Support Matters</h2>

<p>Experiencing both sides of the journey has strengthened their belief that GLP-1 treatments work best when patients receive proper, personalised support. Many online providers rely on quick, asynchronous consultations that offer minimal follow-up, limited guidance and no real relationship with the prescriber. A more supportive and human approach leads to better outcomes and greater confidence.</p>

<p>Video consultations, ongoing check-ins and clear advice on side effects, dosing and building long-term healthy habits can make a meaningful difference. This is exactly what <strong>Medy</strong> offers. Patients receive tailored guidance, compassionate support and market-leading value. Medy combines clinical expertise with genuine care, helping people achieve results and maintain them sustainably.</p>
