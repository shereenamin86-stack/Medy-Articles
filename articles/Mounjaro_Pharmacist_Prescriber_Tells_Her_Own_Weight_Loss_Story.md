<h1>Patient Story: A Pharmacist Prescriber’s Own Journey With Mounjaro</h1>

<p>After more than a year of supporting patients through their GLP-1 weight loss journeys, Shereen, a UK-registered Pharmacist Prescriber, reached an important realisation. She had watched these treatments transform people’s confidence, health and quality of life. Eventually she recognised that it was time to focus on her own wellbeing and take the same step she had guided so many others through.</p>

<p>Shereen had lived with a BMI above 30 and understood her increased health risks, particularly as someone with mixed British and Arab heritage. Despite her clinical background, she was facing real day-to-day limitations. Persistent low back pain affected her mobility and, most emotionally, she had stopped riding her horse. With the weight she had gained, she felt it was no longer in the best interest of her horse’s welfare to ride, which became a difficult but defining moment in her journey.</p>

<p>Before discovering Mounjaro, Shereen had tried many recognised weight loss approaches, including Slimming World, very low calorie diets (VLCDs) of around 800 calories per day and several meal replacement programmes. While some methods worked for short periods, none provided the long-term sustainability she needed.</p>

<p>During the COVID period, she found motivation again and successfully lost 25 kilograms through a keto lifestyle, maintaining her results for almost three years. However, an all-inclusive holiday followed by significant life stresses caused the weight to return more quickly than expected. It felt discouraging to start again after such strong progress.</p>

<h2>Starting Mounjaro: Immediate and Noticeable Effects</h2>

<p>In May, Shereen began her Mounjaro journey, choosing the same treatment she had prescribed to hundreds of her own patients. From the first dose, she noticed a clear physiological shift. She experienced mild nausea on the injection day but also a powerful reduction in appetite and a complete switch off of food noise that lasted the full week until her next injection was due.</p>

<p>When stepping up to 5 milligrams, the journey became more challenging. She experienced more intense nausea, complete appetite suppression, fatigue and sulphur burps. These symptoms were uncomfortable at first but gradually eased as her body adapted. She chose not to increase the dose further as she was progressing well and felt stable. She also experienced some hair shedding which she recognised from her previous keto experience and attributed to rapid weight loss rather than the medication.</p>

<h2>A Life Reclaimed: 23 Kilograms Down and a Return to Normal BMI</h2>

<p>Today, Shereen is 23 kilograms lighter and firmly back within the normal BMI range. She has around 6 to 8 kilograms left to reach her personal goal, yet already feels like herself again. Her low back pain has eased significantly and, most importantly, she is riding her horse again. With improved mobility and strength, she feels confident that she is acting responsibly and prioritising her horse’s welfare.</p>

<h2>A Clinician’s Perspective: Why Proper Support Matters</h2>

<p>Experiencing both sides of the journey has strengthened Shereen’s belief that GLP-1 treatments work best when patients receive proper, personalised support. Many online providers rely on quick, asynchronous consultations that offer minimal follow-up, limited guidance and no real relationship with the prescriber. A more supportive and human approach leads to better outcomes and greater confidence.</p>

<p>Video consultations, ongoing check-ins and clear advice on side effects, dosing and building long-term healthy habits can make a meaningful difference. This is exactly what <strong>Medy</strong> offers. Patients receive tailored guidance, compassionate support and market-leading value. Medy combines clinical expertise with genuine care, helping people achieve results and maintain them sustainably.</p>
