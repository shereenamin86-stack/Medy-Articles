<h2 id="what-are-glp-1-treatments-and-how-do-they-work">What Are GLP-1 Treatments and How Do They Work?</h2>

<p>GLP-1 treatments, also called GLP-1 receptor agonists, are a group of medications originally developed to manage Type 2 diabetes. However, many people are now using them to <strong>support healthy eating habits</strong> and <strong>lose weight</strong>. Popular medicines in this category include <strong>Wegovy</strong> and <strong>Mounjaro</strong>.</p>

<p>GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic a natural hormone in the body called <strong>GLP-1</strong>. This hormone plays a key role in controlling appetite, slowing stomach emptying and regulating blood sugar levels. The result is that you <strong>feel full sooner and for longer</strong>, have <strong>fewer cravings</strong>, and can stick to a healthier eating plan more easily.</p>

<p>Additional benefits of GLP-1 treatments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reducing <strong>cholesterol</strong> levels<sup><a href="#ref1" id="note1">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Improving <strong>fatty liver</strong> disease<sup><a href="#ref2" id="note2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Cutting down the risk of <strong>heart attack</strong> and <strong>stroke</strong><sup><a href="#ref3" id="note3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Mounjaro also works on another hormone called <strong>GIP</strong>, which helps regulate blood sugar and makes it easier to manage appetite. This dual action can support weight loss and improve overall metabolic health.</p>

<p>Stopping GLP-1 weight loss medications can lead to weight regain, even when healthy habits continue. One study indicates that the more weight lost during treatment, the more likely some will be regained.<sup><a href="#ref8" id="note8">8</a></sup> For lasting benefits, these medications are usually most effective as part of a long-term plan to help maintain weight loss and support overall health.

<h2 id="glp-1-side-effects-and-safety-what-to-expect-with-wegovy-and-mounjaro">GLP-1 Side Effects and Safety: What to Expect with Wegovy and Mounjaro</h2>

<p>GLP-1 treatments such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are clinically proven to be effective for weight loss, but they can cause side effects. Understanding what is common, what is rare, and what to look out for helps you to make informed decisions and feel more confident during treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Common side effects</strong></p>

<p>The most frequent patient-reported outcomes for both Wegovy<sup><a href="#ref5" id="note5">5</a></sup> and Mounjaro<sup><a href="#ref6" id="note6">6</a></sup> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
  <li>Diarrhoea or constipation</li>
  <li>Headache</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
  <li>Indigestion</li>
  <li>Injection site reactions</li>
</ul>

<p>These side effects are usually mild to moderate and most frequently occur during dose increases. They tend to improve after continued treatment, as tolerance builds.</p>

<p>Many patients find that making small adjustments to their diet, such as eating smaller portions and reducing fatty foods, as well as maintaining adequate hydration, helps with managing these symptoms. Increasing your treatment strength gradually will also stand you in good stead and reduce side effect occurrence.</p>

<p><strong>Serious and rare side effects</strong></p>

<p>More serious, but far less common, side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pancreatitis</strong>: inflammation of the pancreas that can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea and fever.</li>
  <li><strong>Gallbladder disease</strong>: including gallstones and cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation).</li>
  <li><strong>Hypersensitivity reactions</strong>: anaphylaxis is a rare side effect for both Wegovy and Mounjaro, affecting less than one in 1,000 patients.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who should be cautious</strong></p>

<p>Whilst the following conditions do not necessarily rule out treatment as an option, patients should disclose these before starting treatment to ensure it is a good fit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>History of pancreatitis or gallbladder disease</li>
  <li>Severe gastrointestinal disorders</li>
  <li>Thyroid cancer or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma</li>
  <li>Reduced kidney function</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-glp-1-is-wegovy-or-mounjaro-better-for-you">Choosing the Right GLP-1: Is Wegovy or Mounjaro Better for You?</h2>

<p>When deciding between GLP-1 medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. The right choice depends on a range of personal factors, and here at <a href="https://medy.uk/">Medy</a>, we offer our expertise and support to help you make the right choice and achieve your goals.</p>

<p><strong>Factors to consider:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lifestyle</strong> – both medications are weekly injections, but side effects and tolerability can vary. Both work best alongside healthier diet choices and increased physical activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Health and weight goals</strong> – Mounjaro has demonstrated a <strong>greater average weight loss</strong> than Wegovy in clinical trials,<sup><a href="#ref4" id="note4">4</a></sup> possibly due to its dual GLP-1 and GIP action.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost</strong> – Wegovy and Mounjaro pricing may vary; however, you can rest assured that at <a href="https://medy.uk/">Medy</a>, we strive to offer the most competitive pricing available for the support that we provide.</li>
  <li><strong>Switching between medications</strong> – moving from Wegovy to Mounjaro (or vice versa) is possible, and sometimes necessary due to side effects, cost or efficacy. Doses are not directly equivalent, but our <a href="https://medy.uk/">Medy Clinical Team</a> will be happy to advise on the most suitable option for you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-patient-experiences-life-on-wegovy-and-mounjaro">Real Patient Experiences: Life on Wegovy and Mounjaro</h2>

<p>GLP-1 weight loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, have helped thousands of people take back control of their health. The journey is very individual, and whilst clinical trials offer data, real patient experiences can provide a more personal insight into what you can expect.</p>

<p><strong>Wegovy: steady, consistent progress and appetite control</strong></p>

<p>Patient reports on their Wegovy journey can be grouped into the following main themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong appetite suppression, putting a stop to “food noise” and reducing cravings.</li>
  <li>Moderate weight losses reported within the first few months.</li>
  <li>Boost in confidence and improved sense of well-being.</li>
  <li>Some experienced side effects such as nausea or fatigue in the early stages.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I’ve lost <strong>2.5 stone in 6 months</strong>. It’s not been easy, but <strong>Wegovy</strong> helped me <strong>stay on track</strong> and feel <strong>less hungry</strong>.”</em><br>
  <em>Wegovy user</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mounjaro: faster results with stronger effects</strong></p>

<p>Patients using Mounjaro often report stronger effects and more rapid weight loss, particularly in the first three months. Appetite suppression, reduced “food noise”, and general health benefits are noted, much like with Wegovy. Side effects are very similar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I am so proud to say that <strong>6 months in I have lost 4 and a half stones</strong>… More importantly I just feel so much <strong>healthier</strong> in every way… It’s taken away that <strong>food noise</strong> but what does that mean?? For me it means I can focus on <strong>healthy meal planning</strong> without that insatiable <strong>craving</strong> for sugar.”</em><br>
  <em>Mounjaro user</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every patient’s experience is unique. These stories highlight the importance of finding the right fit for your body, goals and lifestyle, with support from a trusted healthcare provider.</p>
